### Project Overview

 Problem Statement
Hello!
You have been hired by 'CACT'(Census Analysis and Collection Team) to help with your numpy programming skills. Your major work for today involves census record management and data analysis.


### Learnings from the project

 After completing this project, you will have a better grip on working with numpy. In this project, you will apply the following concepts:

Array Appending
Array Slicing
Array Filtering
Array Aggregation


### Approach taken to solve the problem

 Step 1: In this first task, we will load the data to a numpy array and add a new record to it.
Step 2: We often associate the potential of a country based on the age distribution of the people residing there. We too want to do a simple analysis of the age distribution
Step 3: The constitution of the country tries it's best to ensure that people of all races are able to live harmoniously. Let's check the country's race distribution to identify the minorities so that the government can help them.
Step 4: As per the new govt. policy, all citizens above age 60 should not be made to work more than 25 hours per week. Let us look at the data and see if that policy is followed.
Step 5: Our parents have repeatedly told us that we need to study well in order to get a good(read: higher-paying) job. Let's see whether the higher educated people have better pay in general.
