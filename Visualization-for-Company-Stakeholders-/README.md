<br><b>Project Overview</b></br>
<br><b>Problem Statement</b></br>
You have been hired by the stakeholders of Dream Housing Finance company to help them get visual insights on the company's operations. Using the data visualization techniques you learned, you have to help visualise the data and see if you can help the stakeholders arrive at some inference based on the visual plots.

<br><b>Learnings from the project</b></br>
After completing this project, you will have a better understanding of data visualization techniques. In this project, you will be applying the following concepts:<br>
* Bar plotting<br>
* Scatter plotting<br>
* Kernel Density plotting<br>
* Subplot operations<br>
* Axes modifications<br>
<b>Approach taken to solve the problem</b><br>
<b>Step 1:</b><br>
Let's start with the simple task of visualizing the company's record with respect to loan approvals.<br>
<b>Step 2: Everyone needs money </b><br>
The company provides financial assistance across the different regions of the country. One interesting statistic that stakeholders want to see is the loan approval distribution across the regions.<br>
<b>Step 3: Expensive Education </b><br>
Higher education has always been an expensive endeavour for people but it results in better career opportunities and stability in life. But does higher education result in a better guarantee in issuing loans?<br>
<b>Step 4: Smarter and Richer? </b><br>
After seeing the loan status distribution, let's check whether being graduate or not also leads to different loan amount distribution by plotting an overlapping density plot of two values<br>
<b>Step 5: Income vs Loan </b><br>
For any financial institution to be successful in its loan lending system, there has to be a correlation between the borrower's income and loan amount he is lent. Let's see how our company fares in that respect.
